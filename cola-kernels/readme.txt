********** The project is an implementation of CoLA kernels. ************

Kernel Name and corresponding Algorithm
fuse_kernel_1: A * B + C
fuse_kernel_2: Cholesky Inverse
fuse_kernel_3: Singular Value Decomposition
fuse_kernel_4: Arnoldi
fuse_kernel_5: Hutchinson

We have fours folders, 
1. Tests: sanity tests. Run as python/python3 <file name>
2. benchmark: benchmark code. Run as python/python3 <file name>
3. cola_kernels: actually cola kernels implementation
4. Playground: basic usage of CoLA kernels for each kernel. Run as python/python3 <file name>


Installation steps

1. 
2. 




Once installation is done , to run the kernels follow the below steps.

1. Open any of the file in playground folder.
2. Change the value of N
3. Run as python/python3 <file name>
